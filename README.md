# Welcome to the NarwhalSimulator repo!
This is the Github page for Narwhal Simulator. You can play the latest release at [https://jaboc.tech/NarwhalSimulator/index.html ](https://jaboc.tech/NarwhalSimulator/index.html ) (Keep in mind that this is not the latest Github version) or you can watch me develop it here. You can also contribute if you ask first and have the know-how! Thanks, and send all feedback and stuff to jaboc@jaboc.tech
<br/>To play the recommended version, you must download a version of Unity equal to the version contained in ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt __ON THE MAIN BRANCH__

<br/>To play the latest (unstable and probably broken) version, you must download a version of Unity equal to the version contained in ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt __ON THE UNSTABLE BRANCH__

<br/>The recommended version will be updated whenever I feel that Narwhal Simulator is working as it is and there are no large gamebreaking bugs or errors.

<br/>The unstable version will be updated whenever I stop working on it regardless of the state that it is in, so use it if you dare!
